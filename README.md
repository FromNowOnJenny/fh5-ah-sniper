# fh5-ah-sniper
python script to snipe cars in forza by screenshotting &amp; key press simulation

## IMPORTANT
* This is probably against the TOS/community guidelines, so you might get banned (I haven't been for now, even though I snipe very much)
* requires launch arguments if your screen is not 1920x1080
* FH5 has a limit of ho many cars you can buy in the AH every day, this program will not bypass that
* the program is still in development and therefore spamming StdOut very much
* this program is derived from [this program](https://github.com/Scruffydrew/Forza-Horizon-5-Auction-House-Sniper)

## How to use
* requires 16:9 screen
* set UI scaling to 100%
* set brightness to 50
* select filter for AH (car model / max buyout) 
* go in the AH main screen
* start the program
* go back in FH5 window within 5 seconds
* move the mouse to the bottom right corner
* let the program do the work

## Launch arguments
* -x: screen width (default: 1920)
* -y: screen height (default: 1080)
* -c: amount of cars to snipe (default: 9999)
